# 🎯 Project Vision

SG CUBE is built around a simple interaction philosophy:

```text
        🎙️ LISTEN
            ↓
       🧠 UNDERSTAND
            ↓
          👁️ SEE
            ↓
        🔍 ANALYZE
            ↓
        🧠 REMEMBER
            ↓
       💬 RESPOND
            ↓
        🤝 ASSIST
```

Instead of depending only on traditional buttons, menus, and text interfaces, SG CUBE provides a **voice-first interaction model supported by real-time visual perception**.

The goal is to make AI assistance feel more natural, contextual, and accessible.

---

# ✨ Key Features

---

# 🔄 15. Intelligent Application Lifecycle

SG CUBE uses a state-aware voice lifecycle.

### Windows Login

```text
WINDOWS LOGIN
      ↓
Background Listener ON
      ↓
"Hey SG CUBE"
      ↓
SG CUBE Opens
      ↓
Main Voice System Active
      ↓
Background Listener OFF
```

### Sleep

```text
ACTIVE
  ↓
"Go to sleep"
  ↓
Main Microphone OFF
Camera OFF
Gemini OFF
  ↓
Background Listener ON
  ↓
Wait for Wake Word
```

### Closed Application

```text
SG CUBE CLOSED
